						<p>I am very fortunate to have had Jose and his crew at northsdlandscape providing 
							landscaping services at our home in Carlsbad for more than 10 years. He and his 
							colleagues go above and beyond in their service and in their wide knowledge  of
							plants. Any request is gladly executed and special additional services are always
							undertaken professionally and at a reasonable cost. Overall, northsdlandscape is 
							an amazing value with the friendliest landscaping experts you'll find. I highly
							recommend them to anybody!

							We live in Carlsbad, California. For the past 15 years, Jose Cruz, of northSDlandscape
							company, has been our landscape maintenance specialist. We have been very happy with his 
							performance. His dedication, work ethic, expertize, and helpful assistance to us is very 
							much appreciated. Our yard has never looked better.

						<p>
							Recently, he designed a replacement for our side front yard that turned out wonderfully.
							He provides low watering solutions and is able to install new systems. He alerts you to
							possible water issues and corrects them. northSDlandscape company uses a mixture of natural
							fertilizers and uses no chemicals on our lawn, shrubs, hedges, trees, and roses.

						<p>It is a pleasure to recommend the services of North San Diego Landscape. The skilled experts 
							of North San Diego Landscape redesigned our garden and courtyard from top to bottom, and the
							result is a flourishing masterpiece on which we recieve compliments daily. They also desig
							and construct concrete patios, courtyards, and pathways, and the stamped concrete in our garden
							is perfect. Most people sho see it mistake it for slate! If you are looking for a landscape
							service that will work quickly and efficiently, delivering quality work at very reasonable
							rates, North San Diego Landscape is your best option. We feel very lucky to have found them, 
							and a year and a half later, we remain 100% satisfied with our beautiful garden.
